# Comparative Genomic Analysis of FASTA Sequences

## Description
This repository contains genomic sequences in FASTA format from 20 different countries, along with an R history file used for genomic sequence analysis. These resources are designed for comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and bioinformatics studies across various geographic regions.

## Repository Structure:
- **/sequences_fasta/**: Contains FASTA files for each country.
  - `Argentina.fasta`
  - `Australia.fasta`
  - `Belgium.fasta`
  - `Canada.fasta`
  - `Chile.fasta`
  - `china.fasta`
  - `Colombia.fasta`
  - `Ecuador.fasta`
  - `Georgia.fasta`
  - `Greece.fasta`
  - `india.fasta`
  - `Ireland.fasta`
  - `Italy.fasta`
  - `Malaysia.fasta`
  - `NewZealand.fasta`
  - `Poland.fasta`
  - `Romania.fasta`
  - `russia.fasta`
  - `Thailand.fasta`
  - `UK.fasta`
  
- **/scripts/**: Includes the `.Rhistory1.R` file with the R commands used for sequence analysis.

## Usage:
1. Download the FASTA files and run alignment or phylogenetic tools such as BLAST or ClustalW.
2. Refer to the `.Rhistory1.R` file for R-based sequence processing and analysis scripts.

This project serves as a foundation for further analysis in population genomics, epidemiology, or evolutionary biology across different geographical regions.

## Contributing:
Contributions to improve the analysis scripts or add more genomic data are welcome. Please submit a pull request if you'd like to collaborate on this project.
